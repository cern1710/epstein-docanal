# Epstein Document Analysis

Program to generate sentences using Markov models, trained on recently unsealed court filing documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein.

Still a bit hacky, some improvements I plan on implementing:

- [ ] Dynamic n-grams
- [ ] Part-of-speech taggers
- [ ] Hidden Markov Models
- [ ] (Optional) Word embeddings
